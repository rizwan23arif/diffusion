We propose the possibility of using cryptographic notions,
such as diffusion and confusion, to characterize the hardness of SAT in-
stances. The biggest challenge is to find an appropriate method to apply
these notions to SAT instances. We describe a natural way of defin-
ing the discusion of a SAT instance and discuss why this particular way
is not useful in the context of characterizing the hardness of SAT. We
conducted an empirical study to investigate the diffusion and bit inde-
pendence property of problems that vary in their diffculty of inversion.
Some of the results of our study were expected while others were sur-
prising. Using the results of this study, we argue why we believe that
diffusion alone is insuffcient to characterize hardness, and that a combi-
nation of these cryptographic notions together is instead a more suitable
way to characterize hardness.
